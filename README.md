# Sharing Knowledges

We, as developers, are eager to learn more about what's happening in the devs world everyday. 
As we are all knows that everyday, the dev technology are always updating, such as new patches, new updates, new versions, or might be new framework,
programmning language, and so on. The purpose are to create a `better` tools for us, developing something cools.

Sometimes we are not aware of those rapid changes and end up being left behind, the most common problematic scenario is our software/apps/services can't
use/develop more further because we are using EOL plugin, language or framework.

### Purpose

We want to share anything about devs technology from different stacks that being used. Each one of you can share anything as long as it's still related
with devs. And the scope of topic should be focus on certain thing (not to broad). For being speaker, is not only limited to those who are already senior 
or experience in particular stack, we are also welcome for those who are new on particular stack but want to share it, like cheatsheet, best practice, 
new framework, etc. The purpose is `we are learning together`.
